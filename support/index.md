## 2. **Response Time**

The response time depends on the type of support contracted and the severity of the open ticket. The time elapsed between the opening of the ticket and the start of actions taken by Azion is counted.

**Ticket Severity**

Our goal is to provide an appropriate level of urgency to each case based on the impact on your business. Opening tickets with the correct severity level will help us get you in touch with the appropriate support professionals and within the desired response times.

To understand how Azion regards the severity of tickets, please see the table:

| Ticket Severity               | Definition |
|----------------------|-----------|

| System impaired | Non-critical functions of your application are behaving abnormally or you have an urgent development question using Azion products. |
| Production system impaired | Important functions for your application are compromised or degraded. |
| Production system down | You have no way around the problem and your business is significantly impacted. Important functions of your application are unavailable. |
| Business-critical system down | You have no way around the problem and your business is at risk. Critical functions of your application are unavailable. |

**Resolved Cases**

As soon as we respond to your ticket, we will work with you to identify and resolve the issue. We will consider the case resolved if:

*   You agree that your problem has been fixed or your question has been answered.
*   You agree that the source of the problem is not with Azion.
*   You have not responded to an inquiry or request from us for four (4) consecutive days.

**Best Practices Review**

The Azion Trusted Advisors base themselves on the best practices learned from their history of operating and serving thousands of use cases. The Trusted Advisor analyzes your environment at Azion and then informs you of opportunities to save money, improve system architecture, availability and performance, or to help mitigate security vulnerabilities. You can request an analysis through the Support Portal, informing the website you want to be reviewed and the intended objective: optimization with a focus on cost savings, performance, availability or security.
