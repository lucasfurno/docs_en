**Real-Time Events** is an **Edge Analytics** module that allows you to display data from your Azion Products and Services in real time. You can use Real-Time Events to perform complex searches and explore data from your Azion applications.

#### To access Real-Time Events, proceed as follows:

1. Access the [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);
2. Click on the **Products** menu on the top left corner;
3. Select **Real-Time Events** in the **Edge Analytics** section. 

You will see the following fields:

> 1. [Data Sources](#DataSources)
> 2. [Time Filter](#TimeFilter)
> 3. [Filter by](#filterby)
> 4. [Refresh](#Refresh)

## 1. Data Sources {#DataSources}

The first step  to explore your data is choosing the Data Source, which represents the Azion product or service that generated the events.

When submitting a search, the Data Source represents the index from where you want to collect data.

#### Azion provides the following Data Sources:

## 2. Time Filter {#TimeFilter}

Real-Time Events keeps the events from the last 72 hours. The Time Filter allows you to refine the event search result, and is selected by default for *Last 15 minutes*, but you can change the scope of the search  by selecting:

* Last 15 minutes
* Last 30 minutes
* Last 1 hour
* Last 3 hours
* Last 6 hours
* Last 12 hours
* Last day
* Last 2 days
* Last 3 days

> **Note:** Using the *Custom* field, you can also customize your search by selecting a time range during the last 72 hours.

---

## 3. Filter by {#filterby}

In the *Filter by* field, you can optionally filter your search results using a keyword or phrase.

When submitting a search with a blank *Filter by* field, you will get all existing records in the Data Origin, for the selected time filter.

The searches are restricted to a particular field, using the notation: `key='value'`, such as `status='200'`. In this case, you will filter only the records which have these specified pair, value and key. As key, you can use any variable from the tables above, but note that each *Data Source* has its own list of variables.

You may search for more complex field compositions. Use the notations AND, OR and NOT in the search field to combine the fields, such as `status='200' AND scheme='https'`.

The *Filter by* field uses SQL language, therefore you must use “*equals*” (=) after the key and “*single quotes*” ( ' ) around values, for example: `status='200'`.

If you intend to search for a more generic value, you can use the “*like*” operator instead of “*equals*”, exactly like you use in SQL queries. The final query for this search can be `host like '%mydomain%'`.

Depending on the size of our data, the query limit may exceed, if this happens, please filter by a short time filter.

---

## 4. Refresh {#Refresh}

The search always returns the results ordered by the time of the event, from the most recent to the oldest.

You can use the Refresh button to update the returned data, repeating the last search performed.
