### How it works

FetchEvent is the event that passes the request through the _addEventListener_ function. The _addEventListener_, in turn, defines the trigger for executing the JavaScript code and receive the request data.

### Syntax

`addEventListener(type, listener)`

### Properties

event.type: `fetch`

event.request: `request`  - the HTTP request received by the Edge Function.

### Methods

When the Edge Function receives a request, the Runtime executes the FetchEvent, which can be manipulated by the eventListener of a `fetch` type that, in turn, can call the method that defines what will happen until the response:

`event.respondWith(response Request|Promise)` - the HTTP request received by the Edge Function.

### Example

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event))
})
```
