Domains is part of Azion's Real-Time Manager (RTM) platform. This functionality provides you with a domain generation service. With it, you can create a domain with an SSL certificate granted by Azion, free of charge. This is part of the process of creating your Edge Application in the RTM. Domains is also available in a stage enviroment.

## 1. How it works {#how-it-works}

Domains is a standard functionality available for all Edge Applications at Azion. When you create an Edge Application in the Real-Time Manager, you must then access Domains, set it up and link an application to the domain.

If you wish, you may use it to deliver your content over HTTPS, avoiding the costs of issuing SSL certificates, or you can use the domain provided by Azion.

---

## 2. Environment {#environment}

Before pushing traffic live, you can activate a testing configuration to preview setups. When creating a new Domain, select the type of Environment in which you want to create it:

**Production**: select this environment to push it live, making the domain available in production;

**Preview**: choose this environment to create the domain for testing. This configuration will not impact the production environment.

When selecting the **Production** Environment, you will receive a domain name ``xxxx.map.azionedge.net``. When picking out **Preview** Environment, you will receive a domain name ``xxxx.preview.azionedge.net``.

## 3. CNAME {#cname}

It is the standard service responsible for creating CNAME settings, making it possible to replace the domains within Azion. This configuration is also located in Domains. Once you add a domain, the switch for **CNAME Access only** will be enabled automatically. You may disable it, if desired.

---

## 4. Digital Certificates {#digital-certificates}

To use your domain in HTTPS, you will need your SSL Certificate (X.509). You may, without additional costs, include your SSL Certificates in the Real-Time Manager.

## 5. Setting up {#setting-up}

To configure Domains, do as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Domains** in the Edge Computing menu.
2. After, click **Add Domain**.
3. Fill out the fields according to desired configuration:

â€‹	4 Click the **Save** button to finish the process.
