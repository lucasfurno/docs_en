Creating custom rules amplifies the breadth and depth of security levels in your application. You can define custom Allowed Rules to manage and define protocols when configuring your **Web Application Firewall** (WAF). 

That means you're able to set up and manage such lists according to the behavior and traffic between your application and the internet.

## 1. List of protocols {#list-of-protocols}

When creating Allowed Rules in your WAF setup, choose between the available protocols to define this custom composition. Check them below:

## 2. Setting up a custom Allowed Rule {#setting-up}

> To bring a new WAF Rule Set into action, make sure to add it into a Rule in the **Behaviors** section of Edge Firewall's Rules Engine.



1. After defining the WAF configuration, head to the **Allowed Rules** tab.

2. Click **Add Rule**.

3. From the **Rule ID** list, choose a protocol to define the set-up.

4. In the **Rule Description**, write down a suggestive description to identify the ruleset. 

5. The **Path** will be used to restrict the range of a matching zone. If this is undesired, leave it blank.

6. In the **Match Zones** fields, choose the matching zones you'd like to put into the allowlist. You can create as many Match Zones as desired, according to the the type of setup:

- Use **Query String** or **Conditional Query String** to insert all GET arguments or one named argument into the allowlist. For example, the "search" argument;
- Use **Request Header** or **Conditional Request Header** to put all HTTP request headers or one named header into the allowlist. For example, the Cookie header.
- Use **Request Body** or **Conditional Request Body** to insert all POST arguments or one named argument into the allowlist. For example, the "search" argument;
- Use **Raw Body** to use the unparsed (raw) request body into the allowlist;
- Use **File Name (Multipart Body)** to put the file name of a multipart POST containing a file into the allowlist;
- Use **Path** to add the path itself or one named path into the allowlist

7 Once you're done configuring the custom rule, click **Save**.
