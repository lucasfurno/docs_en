# Edge **Firewall - Edge Functions Instances**

By activating the **Edge Functions** module, you can instantiate serverless functions in your **Edge Firewall** at Azion, as well as set up the conditions for its execution. Available for **Edge Application** and **Edge Firewall** products, its use allows you to run serveless functions in our robust distributed network of **Edge Nodes**, responding to events closer to the end user, ensuring greater scalability and availability.

## 1. How it works {#how-it-works}

In **Edge Firewall**, you will have to activate the **Edge Functions** module, so it is possible to use existing functions provided by Azion. For example:

* Shieldsquare Bot Manager
* Secure Token
* Function JWT

When instantiating an **Edge Function**, it is not possible to change its source code, just inform the arguments that will be passed to the context of the function's execution, in *JSON*, through the **Args** tab.

> The **Args** field in **Edge Functions Instance** supports a maximum of 100KB of arguments.

To associate an execution trigger, you simply need to associate the instance with a **Behavior** of a **Rules Engine** Rule, in Request. Thus, when a request meets the criteria defined in the **Rules Engine** rules, **Edge Function** will be invoked and executed directly on Azion's Edges Nodes.

To learn more about how they work and how to apply some of these Edge Functions, visit our [Use Cases](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/use-cases/).

## 2. How to set up {#how-to-set-up}

#### Instantiate and run the functions in your Edge Firewall according to the following steps:

**Note**: You must choose a security solution from **Azion Marketplace** to have access to the options available below.

1.  Go to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and access the products menu **Edge Computing** > **Edge  Firewall**;
2.  Select an **Edge Firewall**;
3.  Activate the **Edge Functions** module in **Main Settings**;
4.  In the **Functions** tab, click  on **Add function** to instantiate the function among the options;
5.  Select the **Args** tab, still in *Functions*, and fill in the necessary information;
6.  Click the **Save** button and you will have instantiated the function;
7.  Select the **Rules Engine** tab and click on **New Rule** to add a rule;
8.  Fill in the fields in **Criteria** to condition your rule;
9.  Set, in your rule, in the **Then** field in **Behavior** the option **Run Function** and select the desired option;
10.  Click on  the **Save** button to save you rule and its function will run when there is a HTTP request.

> To follow the invocations of your functions, access **Real-Time Metrics**, we provide real-time information about the performance of your edge Functions there.
