**Edge Firewall** uses the [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)  per-team permissions system. This way, you have more flexibility when defining the functions and roles of users and teams.

## Users and teams

#### Each user in Real-Time Manager can be associated with teams. You can assign the following access permissions for each team:

| Access                 | Permission                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| View Edge Firewall     | It grants permission to view Edge Firewall Rule Sets, but does not allow creation, removal or modification. |
| Edit Edge Firewall     | It grants permission to view, create, edit and remove Rule Sets from Edge Firewall. |
| View Network Lists     | It grants permission to view Network Lists, but does not allow creation, removal or modification. |
| Edit Network Lists     | It grants permission to view, create, edit and remove Network Lists. |
| View Security Settings | It grants permission to view WAF Rule Sets and Digital Certificates (with the exception of the private key), but does not allow creation, removal or modifications. |
| Edit Security Settings | It grants permission to view, create, edit and remove WAF Rule Sets and Digital Certificates. |

#### How to configure Edge Firewall permissions:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) with an administrator account  privilege (admin) and go to the **Account  menu** on  the header's top right section;

2. Select the **Teams** menu;

3. Edit existing teams or add a new team in **Add team**;

4. Add a name for your team if you are creating a new team;

5. Confirm **View/Edit Edge Firewall** or **View/Edit Network Lists**;

6. Select the **Active** field to activate your selection;

7. Click the **Save** button to save your configuration;

8. Access **Users** in the same menu;

9. Edit existing users or add a User in **Add User**;

10. Fill in the fields in **User profile** and **Contact information** in case you add new users;

11. In **Security Settings**, leave the **Account owner** field activated or deactivated according to the desired access permission for each user:

    > **Account owner**: Full access to all resources, including account management and solutions.
    >
    > **Non-owner**: Restricted access to the solution management, based on the teams' permissions.

12. Add the teams whose permissions the user will inherit;

13. Click the  **Save** button to save your configuration.

    > If you want to add an extra security layer to your account, enable the **Multi-Factor Authentication field**.
