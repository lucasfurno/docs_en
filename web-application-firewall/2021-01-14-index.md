The **Web Application Firewall** (WAF) protects your applications against threats such as SQL Injections, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more. WAF scans HTTP, and HTTPS requests detect and block malicious activities before reaching your infrastructure and without impacting your applications' performance.

It is a barrier that uses a set of rules to filter and monitor the traffic between your application and the internet. It operates in layer 7, known as the application layer, where applications access network services.

## 1. How it works {#howitworks}

**Web Application Firewall** is an Azion Edge Firewall’s module based on the request scoring methodology. Each *http/https* request is compared to a set of extremely restrictive blocking rules and receives a score for each family of threat.

According to the received score by the request, it can be released or blocked directly at Azion’s Edge Nodes before the threat reaches your origin or causes any damage. You define the desired sensitivity level to block each threat family.

To avoid blocking licit requests and malfunctioning of your application, you must run a learning stage, in which the WAF Rule Set identifies legitimate behaviors in your application, inserting them into an *Allowed rules list*.

You can also monitor the behavior and effectiveness of your **Web Application Firewall** settings. Through our **Real-Time Events** and **Data Streaming** tools, Azion provides dashboards and reports for online and real-time event log checks. Furthermore, you may import Azion’s log records and manipulate them within your own analysis tools.

> To use your WAF Rule Sets resources you need to enable the Web Application Firewall module in the Edge Firewall Rule Set.

### Operation Mode

In order to get maximum performance and accuracy from the product, the learning stage is required. See the two modes of operation to support you in this stage:

| Operation Mode | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Counting Mode  | It is used to specify that the WAF should not block any request. Your applications’ traffic will be analyzed and the threats found will only be counted. Use this mode of operation during the first learning stage. |
| Blocking Mode  | It is used to analyze and block detected threats, protecting your applications from malicious users. You can run the learning stage whenever you think it is necessary, even during Blocking Mode. |

### Families of Threats

Threats are categorized into families, according to the purpose of the attack. You can enable or disable protection for each threat family individually, according to the protections required by the type of your application and the features it provides.


| Threat Type                  | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL Injections Sensitivity   | It detects attack attempts by injecting SQL code into the application. |
| Remote File Inclusions (RFI) | It detects attempts to include files, usually through scripts, on the web server. |
| Directory Traversal          | It prevents exploitation of vulnerability regarding insufficient sanitization of file name fields provided by users, so that characters representing shortcuts to the parent directory are passed through the file API. |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)   | It prevents the injection of client-side scripts into pages viewed by your visitors. |
| File Upload                  | It detects the attemp to upload files to the web server.     |
| Evading Tricks               | It prevents some coding tricks used to try to evade the protection mechanisms. |
| Unwanted Access              | It detects attempts to access administrative or vulnerable pages, bots and security scanning tools. |
| Identified Attacks           | It prevents several types of common attacks and known vulnerabilities that should certainly be blocked. |

### Sensitivity

Sensitivity defines how strictly the WAF will consider a request as a threat, see the details of each level below.

#### Lowest

It is a lower level of sensitivity. The request will be considered a threat if it presents very strong evidence and receives a high score. This sensitivity has a lower level of protection for your applications, but it will also avoid blocking requests with less chance of representing threats - false positives.

#### Low

It is a lower level of sensitivity. The request will be considered a threat if it presents very strong evidence and receives a high score. This sensitivity has a lower level of protection for your applications, but it will also avoid blocking requests with less chance of representing threats - false positives.

#### Medium

It is the level of sensitivity recommended by Azion. The request will be considered a threat if it presents sufficient evidence and receives an intermediate score.

#### High

It is the high level of protection for your application. At the slightest hint of a threat, the request can be blocked, even when it has a relatively low score. This level of sensitivity may have more false positives if the learning stage does not have enough coverage of the variability of scenarios and uses of your application.

#### Highest

It is the highest level of protection for your application. At the slightest hint of a threat, the request can be blocked, even when it has a very low score. This level of sensitivity may show many false positives, if the learning stage does not have enough coverage on the variability of scenarios and uses of your application.

### Rules {#rules}

The set of rules which increase the score of a request. The bigger the score is, the higher is the probability of a request to be considered an attack by WAF.

Azion works with an extremely restrictive set of rules to ensure the security of your application. Each rule consists of the following fields.

| Field            | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rule Id          | Unique numeric ID for each rule of the WAF.                  |
| Rule Description | A textual description of what the rule does.                 |
| Match Pattern    | Comparison condition, string or regex, which will be sought in the request. |
| Path             | When specified, restrict the application of the *Match Zone* to the defined *path* only. *Path* delimits the scope of the rule. |
| Match Zones      | Parts or fields of the requisition that will be compared to the *Match Pattern*. These can be:<br/>**Path:** *match pattern* will be compared to the *path* of the request.<br/>**Query String:** *match pattern* will be compared to the *query string*, also called GET *arguments*.<br/>**Request Header:** *match pattern* will be compared to the HTTP headers of the request.<br/>**Request Body:** *match pattern* will be compared to the *body* of a POST, also called POST *arguments*.<br/>**File Name (Multipart Body)**: *match pattern* will be compared to the file names in *multipart POSTs*.<br/>**Raw Body:** *match pattern* will be compared to *body* that was not interpreted from a request, also called *unparsed body*. |
| Attack Family    | The attack family(s) for which the rule increases the score. |

------

### Custom Allowed Rules

With Custom Allowed Rules, you are able to choose protocols to define allowed rules in your application. You can choose one or several policies to configure a setup, meaning you will authorize your Web Application Firewall to not see certain behaviors that could be interpreted as threats.
