## 3. Creating a new Edge Application {#create-new-edge-application}

#### After activating your account, you must create your first edge application. To create a new configuration, follow the steps below:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)  with your email and password;

2. In **Edge Computing**, select **Edge Application**;

3. Click on **Add Application** on the top right corner menu;

4. Fill in the requested fields;

   > Check the fields to be filled and after filling them in click on **Save**, to save your edge application.

Enter the following fields:

#### **Name for Application** 

Give your edge application a suggestive name. This name will be used to identify your settings. You can use the domain name of your web application itself as a name.

*For example: www.azion.com*

#### **Main Settings**

In this section, the main fields related to the delivery of your applications are defined: **HTTP** or **HTTP & HTTPS** And, also, the **Minimum TLS version** field.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| **Delivery Protocol** | Choose the delivery protocol supported by your web application:<br>**HTTP:** if your application only supports the HTTP protocol.<br><br>**HTTP & HTTPS:** if your application supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. To use HTTPS, you will need [Digital Certificates]({% tl documentation_products_edge_applications_digital_certificates %}). |
| **Minimum TLS version** | Transport Layer Security (TLS) guarantees encrypted communications between a client and a web server via HTTPS.<br/>PCI standards recommend the use of TLS 1.2 or higher. Remember, if you use newer versions, some older client devices or browsers will not be able to connect. |

#### **Origins**

**Origins** is where you define your origin data. To understand more about how the **Edge Applications** works, what the origins is for, or how to make more advanced origin settings, see the product's technical documentation.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| **Origin Type** | The following fields refer to the Single Origin type. |
| **Address** | Define the origin address of your application, in FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) format, for example origin.azion.com, or IP address.<br><br>By default, Azion will connect to your origin through port 80, for HTTP, or 443, for HTTPS. If you want to configure a different port to connect to your origin, you can use the host:port notation in this field, for example origin.azion.com:8080. See the field below to understand options for connecting to your origin..<br><br>You cannot configure as the origin the same delivery domain used for your content delivery. The origin must have its own address. |
| **Origin Protocol Policy** | In the reverse proxy architecture adopted by Azion, its users connect to Intelligent Edge via HTTP or HTTPS and you choose how you want Azion to connect to your origin:<br><br>**Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol:** it will keep the same connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin.<br><br>**Enforce HTTP:** the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (80 for HTTP) if you wish.<br><br>**Enforce HTTPS:** the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if you wish. |
| **Host Header** |The Host header is used by your origin to identify the virtualhost and locate your content or application. When setting up an origin in Real-Time Manager, you can customize the value that must be sent by Azion in the Host header.<br><br>Use the value *${host}*, in the Host Header field, if your origin is configured to answer to virtualhost for the same domain that is used by its users to access the content on Azion. This way, you will be instructing Edge Nodes to forward the same Host header that is received from your visitors to their origin.<br><br>If necessary, you can fill in a custom value for Host Header to be sent to your origin. For example, origin.domain.com. You must customize the Host Header if your origin is configured to respond to a virtualhost at a domain different than the one used by its users. |

#### **Cache Settings**

In this section, the cache options for your content will be defined. There are two types of cache:

* Browser Cache is the cache of your content that is stored in your users' browsers. You can define the time-to-live (TTL) for each content, but you have little autonomy to force the content to expire before the time defined as TTL, in case there is a need to change the content ahead of time.
* CDN Cache is your content cache on Azion's Edge Nodes. In addition to being able to set the TTL for each type of content, you will be able to perform the Purge operation of the content in real time, whenever there is a need to delete the data stored in the cache.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| **Browser Cache Settings** | Use the *Honor Origin Cache Headers* option if you want Azion to send its users the same cache control headers received from their origin.<br><br>You can also customize the Browser Cache control by selecting the *Override Cache Settings* option. In this case, you must define a **Maximum TTL**, which is the maximum lifetime (in seconds) that the content can be cached in your users' browser. |
| **CDN Cache Settings** | Use the *Honor Origin Cache Headers* option if you want Azion to respect the cache control headers received from your origin, for managing the cache on Azion's Edge Nodes. You can also customize the CDN Cache control by selecting the *Override Cache Settings* option. In this case, you must define a **Maximum TTL**, which is the maximum lifetime (in seconds) that the content can be cached in Azion’s Edge Nodes. You can, at any time, purge the content in real time. |

Click on the **Save** button before leaving the page.

>If you wish, you can edit your newly created edge application to see the advanced options.

## 4. Creating a new Domain associated with your Edge Application {#create-new-domain-associated-edge-application}

#### After creating your first edge application, you must associate one or more domains for your users to access:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) using your email and password;

2. In **Edge Computing**, select **My Domains**;

3. Click on the **Add Domain** button;

4. Fill in the requested fields.

   >Check the fields to be filled and then click on **Save**, to save your settings.

Enter the following fields:

#### **Add Name Configuration**

Give your Edge Application a suggestive name. This name will be used to identify your configuration. You can use your web application's own domain as a name.

*Example: www.azion.com*

#### **Settings**

In this section, the main fields related to the delivery of your applications are defined.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| **Digital Certificate** | If you selected *HTTP & HTTPS* during the creation of your edge application, you must select the SSL certificate that will be used to encrypt your HTTPS traffic. Azion provides the certificate *Azion (SAN)* that can be used for the domains below *azioncdn.net.*<br>You can also upload your Custom Certificate at any time. Consult the [Digital Certificates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/) documents and learn how to do it. |
| **CNAMEs** | Configure the list of delivery domains (CNAMEs) for your content or application. If necessary, you can use Wildcard Domain (* *.yourdomain.com*).<br>*Example: www.azion.com* <br> <br> List the domains you want to use as a URL for your files.<br/>Thus, you replace the address provided by Azion (e.g. 10001a.hc.azioncdn.net) with the listed domains.<br/>In this case you should register the CNAMEs in your DNS service to redirect any routes of your CNAME to those indicated by Azion.<br/>For example, replace www.example.com with 10001a.hc.azioncdn.net |
| **CNAME Access Only** | By default, all Domain configurations are automatically assigned a domain name below *azioncdn.net*.<br>By checking this option, you will be configuring the Edge Application to deliver your content or applications only through the domains listed in the CNAME field. |
| **Edge Application** | In this field you select the edge application that you want to associate with this delivery domain. |

> Click on the **Save** button after filling in all the fields to save your changes.

## 5.Changing your applications' DNS to the Domain created {#change-your-application-DNS}

After associating a Domain to your edge application, you will see a list of existing settings in your account.

For each configuration created, a **Domain Name** is automatically assigned below the  * *.ha.azioncdn.net* domain.

You will need this domain to approve the operation of your new configuration. To make your configuration run, you will have to point the domain of your content to the Domain Name assigned to your configuration, through a CNAME type record in your DNS server.

>You must carefully approve your content and web application before directing the DNS to Azion's Domain Name.
