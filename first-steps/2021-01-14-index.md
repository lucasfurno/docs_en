## **Basic setups to get you started with Azion**

To get you started, make sure you have an account to sign into RTM. These next steps will get you started with our platform so that you can build and deliver applications running at the Edge.



### 4. Creating and activating Edge Application {#creating-app}

From the home screen, select **Edge Computing** > **Edge Application** and click **Add Application**. You have to define a name for this Application. Next, you must fill out the following fields:

**Main Settings**

In this section, you will define the main fields related to the delivery of your Applications: **HTTP** or **HTTP & HTTPS.** And, also, the **Minimum TLS version** and **Ports** fields.

| Field                   | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Delivery Protocol**   | Define your **Delivery Protocol** and **Port HTTP** (which has different patterns for different web servers). Choose the protocol supported by your web application.**HTTP:** if your application only supports the HTTP protocol.<br/>**HTTP & HTTPS:** if your application supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. To use HTTPS, you will need Digital Certificates.<br />*If you choose HTTP/HTTPS as the Delivery protocol, you must enter the HTTPS port and the TLS.* |
| **Minimum TLS version** | Transport Layer Security (**TLS**) guarantees encrypted communications between a client and a web server via HTTPS.PCI standards recommend the use of TLS 1.2 or higher. Remember, if you use new versions, some older client devices or browsers will not be able to connect. |

**Origins**

Origins is where you define your origin data. To understand more about how Edge Applications work, origins, or creating advanced origin setups, read the [product documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/).

| Field                      | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Origin Type**            | The following fields refer to the Single Origin type. Because you are creating a new Application, **Single Origin** is the only option.<br />*After creating and saving a new Application, you can turn Load Balancer on.* |
| **Address**                | This field defines the address in which you run your application or origin. Define the origin address of your Application in FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) format. For example origin.azion.com, or an IP address.<br/><br />*By default, Azion will connect to your origin through port 80, for HTTP, or 443, for HTTPS. Suppose you want to configure a different port to connect to your origin. In that case, you can use the host:port notation in this field, for example, origin.azion.com:8080. See the field below to understand options for connecting to your origin*<br/><br />Note: you cannot configure as the origin the same delivery domain used for your content delivery. The origin must have its own address. |
| **Origin Protocol Policy** | The **Origin Protocol Policy** defines how Azion will connect to the origin. If you choose to preserve protocol, Azion will use the same when connecting to the origin. In the reverse proxy architecture adopted by Azion, users connect to the Edge Nodes via HTTP or HTTPS, and you choose how you want Azion to connect to your origin:<br/>**Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol:** it will keep the same connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin.<br/><br />**Enforce HTTP:** the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (80 for HTTP) if you wish.<br/><br />**Enforce HTTPS:** the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if you wish. |
| **Host Header**            | This information is used to define which application should be accessed, enabling the origin server to distinguish among resources while servicing requests for multiple hostnames on a single IP address. <br/>Your origin uses the Host header to identify the virtualhost and locate your content or Application. When setting up an origin in Real-Time Manager, you can customize the value that Azion must send in the Host header.<br /><br />Use the value *${host}* in the Host Header field if your origin is configured to answer to virtualhost for the same domain that its users use to access the content on Azion. This way, you will be instructing Edge Nodes to forward the same Host header that is received from your visitors to their origin.<br/><br />If necessary, you can fill in a custom value for Host Header to be sent to your origin. <br />*For example, origin.domain.com. You must customize the Host Header if your origin is configured to respond to a virtualhost at a domain different than the one used by its users.* |

**Cache Settings** 

In this section, you will define the cache options for your content. There are two types of cache:

| **Field**                  | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Browser Cache Settings** | Browser Cache is the cache of your content that is stored in your users’ browsers. You can define the time-to-live (TTL) for each content. Still,  you have little autonomy to force the content to expire before the time defined as TTL, in case there is a need to change the content ahead of time.Here, you can choose between honoring or overriding cache settings. That is, the time that content should be kept in the user's browser cache. <br/><br />Choose between **Honor Origin Cache Headers** or **Override Cache Settings.**<br/><br />*If you choose to **Override** the settings, you must enter the TTL in seconds, which is how long content will stay in cache.* |
| **CDN Cache Settings**     | Here, you define how your content is kept in cache on Azion’s Edge Nodes. In addition setting the TTL for each type of content, you will be able to perform the Purge operation of the content in real-time, whenever there is a need to delete the data stored in the cache.<br /><br />Use the **Honor Origin Cache Headers** option if you want Azion to respect the cache control headers received from your origin, for managing the cache on Azion’s Edge Nodes. You can also customize the CDN Cache control by selecting the **Override Cache Settings** option. In this case, you must define a **Maximum TTL**, which is the maximum lifetime (in seconds) that the content can be cached in Azion’s Edge Nodes |

After defining the previous information, click **Save** to finish this step.



### 5. Creating a new Domain associated with your Edge Application {#creating-domain}

Next, we are going to set up **Domains.** After creating your Edge Application, you must associate one or more domains for your users to access.

You can access Domains from the homepage or by clicking the left menu indicator. Click **Add Domain**. Don't forget to name this configuration.
Enter the following information:

| Field                   | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Digital Certificate** | The usual setup is to use Azion's certificate. If you'd like to add another certificate, head to the menu and look for the **Digital Certificates** section.<br /><br />If you selected *HTTP & HTTPS* during the creation of your Edge Application, you must select the SSL certificate that will be used to encrypt your HTTPS traffic. Azion provides the certificate *Azion (SAN)* that can be used for the domains below *azioncdn.net.* <br /><br />You can also upload your Custom Certificate at any time. Consult the[ Digital Certificates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/) documents and learn how to do it. |
| **CNAMEs**              | Configure the list of delivery domains (CNAMEs) for your content or application. If necessary, you can use Wildcard Domain (* *.yourdomain.com*). *Example: www.azion.com* <br/><br />List the domains you want to use as a URL for your files by hitting enter.<br />Thus, you replace the address provided by Azion (for example, 10001.map.azionedge.net) with the listed domains.<br />In this case, you should register the CNAMEs in your DNS service to redirect any routes of your CNAME to those indicated by Azion.<br />For example, replace www.example.com with 10001.map.azionedge.net. |
| **CNAME Access Only**   | By default, all Domain configurations are automatically assigned a domain name below *azioncdn.net*.<br /><br />By checking this option, you will be configuring the Edge Application to deliver your content or applications only through the domains listed in the CNAME field. |
| **Edge Application**    | Select the Edge Application you want to associate with this delivery domain. |

Once you finish the setup, click **Save.** 



### 6. Linking your application traffic to the Azion Platform {#linking}

After associating a Domain to your Edge Application, you will see a list of existing settings in your account. For each configuration created, a **Domain Name** is automatically assigned as ``*.map.azionedge.net``.

You will need this domain to approve the operation of your new configuration. To make your configuration run, you will have to point the domain of your content to the Domain Name assigned to your configuration, through a CNAME type record in your DNS server.

Every Azion Domain has a self-generated Azion CNAME associated with it that will be used as the address for DNS records.

> If you're using a Digital Certificate for your real DNS name, the HTTPS requests to Azion CNAME will return as 'insecure connection' due to DNS mismatch.

To get your application running through Azion, follow these steps:

- Go to your current DNS Server or Service.
- Set the DNS record value of the application to the Azion CNAME address (this is found in your **Domain**). It is mandatory to have a CNAME (not A or AAAA) entry so that the Azion network can start delivering dynamic self-balanced IP addresses to the users. 
- Check on **Edge Analytics** > **Real-Time Metrics** to confirm the incoming traffic.

> If you use a naked domain (http:// mydomain.com) for your application, you also must check for ANAME entry support in your DNS server. Otherwise, you may consider migrating your entire DNS zone to our [Intelligent DNS product](https://www.azion.com/en/products/intelligent-dns/) or talking to our [Support](https://tickets.azion.com/).



### 7. Keeping your account after the trial period {#keeping}

To avoid interruption of your services after the trial period, follow the steps below:

1. Access RTM and go to the [Billing](https://manager.azion.com/account/932/payment_method/add/) section of the account menu.
2. Enter valid credit card information.
3. Click the **Save** button to save your billing details.

Every month you will receive an e-mail containing your usage levels and charges to your account during that period of time. The e-mail contains a PDF with the invoice detailing charges, period, and invoice ID.

You can change the billing contact in the **Account Info** section of the account menu.
