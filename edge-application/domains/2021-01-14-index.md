My Domains is part of Azion's Real-Time Manager (RTM) platform. This functionality provides you with a domain generation service. With it, you can create a domain with an SSL certificate granted by Azion, free of charge. This is part of the process of creating your Edge Application in the RTM.

## 1. How it works {#how-it-works}

My Domains is standard functionality available for all Edge Applications at Azion. When you create an Edge Application in the Real-Time Manager, you must then access My Domains, set it up and link an application to the domain.

If you wish, you may use it to deliver your content over HTTPS, avoiding the costs of issuing SSL certificates, or you can use the domain provided by Azion.

---

## 2. CNAME {#cname}

It is the standard service responsible for creating CNAME settings, making it possible to replace the domains within Azion. This configuration is also located in My Domains. Once you add a domain, the switch for **CNAME Access only** will be enabled automatically. You may disable it, if desired.

---

## 3. Digital Certificates {#digital-certificates}

To use your domain in HTTPS, you will need your SSL Certificate (X.509). You may, without additional costs, include your SSL Certificates in the Real-Time Manager.

## 4. Setting up {#setting-up}

To configure My Domains, do as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Domains** in the Edge Computing menu.
2. After, click **Add Domain**.
3. Fill out the fields according to desired configuration:

**Domains**
Add Configuration Name: choose a name for your domain.

**Settings**
Digital Certificate: you can use a domain provided by Azion or upload your custom one.

CNAME: list the domains you want to use as a URL for your files, using new lines to separate the URLs.

CNAME Access Only: the switch will be toggled on as standard configuration. Enabling it makes content only accessible through the domains defined in the CNAME field.

Edge Application: select the edge application which will receive the domain.

​	4 Click the **Save** button to finish the process.
